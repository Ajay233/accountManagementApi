# Account Management API

This API has been created to provide a way to reuse a single account across multiple apps.  Account management and login features are common among all of my apps; however, by having these implemented individually for each app, users will have to create a new account for each app they want to try out.  To simplify this and to speed up development of future apps I have created this API to provide the functionality to create and manage accounts as well as login and retrieve user details via this API.
